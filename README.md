*New Resource - Postgres Homework*

Your aim is to continue your new resource of your choice for example *Posts* for a Blog site or *Cars* for a Transport site.

Your site will need to have the following:-

- All the restful routes for your resource which should be working
- Your routes should be separated out into their own class
- It should include all the relevant ERB templates for the routes that render HTML
- At least two partials
- A layout template
- A new database using Postgres
- Forms to manage creation and update of resource (Must reuse the forms)
- You data should be persist even when you restart your server
- Links to navigate around the CRUD actions on your site so you dont need to navigate via the url
- Styling to make the site look really really really good
